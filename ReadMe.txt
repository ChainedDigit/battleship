The game was made and only tested on Windows 10. Ngl, it probably doesn't work anywhere else.

All you need is already included in the .exe program. 
Just download and run it. 
But just in case, here's the info:

The game plays in 3 phases:

1- choose a difficulty
  Choose a difficulty from 1 to 4.
  Legit just click [1], [2], [3] or [4] on your keyboard.

2- place your boat
  Use [w] [a] [s] [d] to move the cursor around. The boat will follow.
  Use [e], [r] or [f] to rotate the boat. (Don't worry, it won't exit the grid. At least, not anymore...)
  Use [space] to place the boat. You'll move on to the next one automatically.

3- attack until only one of you remains
  Use [w] [a] [s] [d] to move the cursor around.
  Use [space] to fire on the chosen tile.
